### Abstract

> To advance human-like AI, we need actionable definitions and measures of intelligence. Historical definitions often confuse task-specific skill with general intelligence. This paper introduces a new definition based on skill-acquisition efficiency, considering scope, generalization difficulty, priors, and experience. A benchmark, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), is proposed to assess human-like general intelligence.

### Key Points

#### The Problem

-	AI Limitations: Current AI systems excel at narrow tasks but lack adaptability and generalization.
-	Misleading Metrics: Skill-based evaluations fail to measure true intelligence as they often depend on extensive prior knowledge or training data.

#### Intelligence Defined

1.	Task-Specific Skill: Success at predefined tasks (e.g., chess or video games).
2.	General Learning Ability: The capacity to adapt and learn new tasks independently.

### Proposed Definition

Intelligence is skill-acquisition efficiency:
-	Scope: The range of tasks an agent can handle.
-	Generalization Difficulty: The novelty and complexity of tasks.
-	Priors & Experience: The knowledge and data available to the system.

### The ARC Benchmark

#### What It Is

> ARC evaluates the ability to generalize, using tasks requiring reasoning and abstraction. It minimizes reliance on specific priors, mirroring innate human cognition.

#### Why It’s Important

-	Fair Comparisons: Tests both humans and AI under similar conditions.
-	Focus on Generality: Prioritizes adaptability over specialized skill.

### Challenges & Future Directions

1.	Bias in Evaluation: Task-specific evaluations favor systems with extensive training or priors.
2.	Benchmark Limitations: The ARC dataset is a step forward but not perfect. Broader, more diverse tasks are needed.
3.	Human Reference Frame: Intelligence should be assessed relative to human capabilities and priorities.

### Conclusion

A meaningful AI intelligence measure must focus on generalization and adaptability, not task-specific performance. By adopting benchmarks like ARC, we can align AI progress with human-like intelligence goals.
