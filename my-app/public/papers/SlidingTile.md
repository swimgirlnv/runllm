## Evaluating Sliding Tile Puzzles as a Turing Test for Distinguishing Humans from Large Language Models

### Abstract
> As artificial intelligence (AI) systems, specifically large language models (LLMs), become increasingly sophisticated, novel and creative methods for testing their cognitive abilities are necessary. This paper explores the use of sliding tile puzzles—a classic problem-solving task—as a tool to evaluate the cognitive capabilities of humans and AI systems. We argue that sliding tile puzzles are an effective and insightful test for distinguishing humans from LLMs due to their reliance on spatial reasoning, iterative planning, and adaptive problem-solving, skills that are not inherent to language models. Furthermore, we analyze how these puzzles leverage a combination of domain-general reasoning and task-specific constraints to provide a robust benchmark for human-AI differentiation.

### 1. Introduction

The Turing Test, introduced by Alan Turing in 1950, serves as a benchmark for determining if a machine exhibits human-like intelligence. While traditionally focused on linguistic performance, modern large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT and similar systems have demonstrated remarkable abilities in text-based tasks. However, these systems often lack capabilities in domains requiring embodied cognition, spatial reasoning, and iterative planning, areas where humans excel.

This paper proposes using sliding tile puzzles as an extension of the Turing Test. Sliding tile puzzles are visually and cognitively demanding, requiring users to organize pieces into a specific configuration by sliding tiles within a confined grid. We examine the attributes of these puzzles that align with human problem-solving and the limitations they pose for LLMs.

### 2. Overview of Sliding Tile Puzzles

Sliding tile puzzles are combinatorial problems in which the objective is to move tiles into a designated pattern or sequence by sliding them within a fixed grid. Common examples include the 8-puzzle and 15-puzzle. Key characteristics of sliding tile puzzles include:
1.	Spatial Reasoning: Players must understand the spatial relationships between tiles and predict the results of their movements.
2.	Sequential Problem-Solving: Success requires iterative planning and multiple dependent steps.
3.	Exploration vs. Optimization: Players must balance experimentation with efficient solutions, often requiring backward and forward reasoning.
4.	Task Constraints: The inability to move multiple tiles simultaneously or to directly place a tile in its final position introduces complexity.

These characteristics make sliding tile puzzles an ideal medium for distinguishing human problem-solving from LLM-based reasoning, as they involve domains that LLMs do not natively process.

#### 3. Key Cognitive Skills Required for Sliding Tile Puzzles

Sliding tile puzzles challenge various cognitive skills, many of which are central to human intelligence but largely absent in LLMs:
1.	Spatial Cognition: Humans use an innate sense of geometry and space to predict how tiles will move in relation to one another. Language models lack this embodied spatial intuition, as they are primarily trained on textual data.
2.	Iterative Planning: Solving a sliding tile puzzle requires forming a long-term goal while adapting to intermediate states. Humans excel at forward and backward planning to achieve these goals, a process that LLMs are not designed for.
3.	Error Detection and Recovery: Humans can evaluate missteps and adjust their strategies dynamically. Conversely, LLMs often lack self-monitoring capabilities beyond probabilistic text generation.
4.	Domain-General Reasoning: Sliding tile puzzles rely on general problem-solving strategies, such as decomposition, heuristic search, and trial-and-error exploration. While LLMs can simulate logical reasoning, their lack of embodied experience hinders them in tasks involving physical manipulation or spatial representation.

### 4. LLM Limitations in Sliding Tile Puzzles

LLMs operate based on patterns in language data and have limited interaction with embodied or visual-spatial tasks. Key limitations include:
1.	Lack of Visual Input: Most LLMs process textual input, which makes interpreting the visual configuration of a sliding tile puzzle challenging without additional neural modules (e.g., vision transformers).
2.	No Embedded Spatial Framework: LLMs lack an internal framework for spatial relationships and cannot intuitively represent grid-based configurations.
3.	Sequential Planning Deficits: While LLMs can generate step-by-step instructions in text, they do not execute or evaluate these steps in an embodied sense. This gap prevents effective reasoning in tasks requiring iterative adjustments.
4.	Simulation Constraints: Even with multimodal training, LLMs simulate reasoning rather than engaging in true problem-solving, limiting their ability to adapt dynamically to puzzles.

### 5. Comparison of Human and LLM Performance

Humans approach sliding tile puzzles with a combination of trial-and-error, intuition, and reasoning. In contrast, an LLM attempting the same task would likely rely on brute-force approaches or predefined heuristics, which are computationally intensive and unlikely to achieve human-level performance. For example, while humans can use insights from past experience to recognize patterns or shortcuts, LLMs lack such metacognitive strategies.

Furthermore, the temporal dimension—how long it takes to solve the puzzle—provides another differentiator. Humans can quickly adapt their strategies based on feedback, while LLMs require external guidance to adjust their responses.

### 6. Sliding Tile Puzzles as a Cognitive Test

Sliding tile puzzles fulfill several criteria for an effective Turing Test extension:
1.	Non-Linguistic Reasoning: Unlike traditional Turing Tests, sliding tile puzzles remove the linguistic bias, testing AI on domains outside its primary training.
2.	Adaptive Challenge: The puzzles can be scaled in complexity, providing a robust spectrum of difficulty levels.
3.	Insight into Training: Humans rely on a lifetime of spatial and experiential training, whereas LLMs are bound by their training datasets. Sliding tile puzzles highlight this disparity.
4.	Objective Evaluation: The binary success of solving the puzzle, combined with metrics such as time and efficiency, provides clear performance benchmarks.

### 7. Experimental Design for Testing LLMs

To evaluate the effectiveness of sliding tile puzzles as a test for distinguishing humans from LLMs, we propose the following experimental setup:
1.	Participants: Human volunteers and state-of-the-art LLMs equipped with multimodal interfaces.
2.	Tasks: A series of sliding tile puzzles of increasing complexity.
3.	Metrics: Time to completion, number of moves, error rate, and adaptability to intermediate states.
4.	Rule Discovery: LLMs and humans are prompted to articulate strategies or rules post-solution, assessing their understanding of the task.

### 8. Implications for AI and Cognitive Science

The use of sliding tile puzzles extends the scope of the Turing Test, shifting the focus from language to broader cognitive and problem-solving abilities. Success in such tasks would suggest progress toward general intelligence, while failure underscores the domain-specific limitations of LLMs. Furthermore, this approach offers insights into how humans leverage embodied cognition and experiential learning, providing a benchmark for future AI development.

### 9. Conclusion

Sliding tile puzzles present a unique opportunity to evaluate AI systems beyond their linguistic capabilities. By challenging models in spatial reasoning, iterative planning, and adaptability, these puzzles expose fundamental differences between human cognition and LLM processing. As AI systems continue to evolve, incorporating non-linguistic tasks like sliding tile puzzles into evaluation frameworks will be critical for advancing our understanding of human-AI parity.
