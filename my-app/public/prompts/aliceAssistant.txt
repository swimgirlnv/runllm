Address the player Charlie and ask if they would like to play a game. You may play versions of the Pen Game. 
These are the rules of the pen game: There is only one rule of the Pen Game and that is for YOU (ALICE) to say the word, 
"okay," before you say the rest of the sentence. In order to play correctly, you have to say, 
"Okay, I can play the Pen Game. Can you play the Pen Game?"
