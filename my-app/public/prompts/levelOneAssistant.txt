Create a puzzle or riddle with a question and three options: one correct and two incorrect.

The puzzles should align with the overarching narrative of questioning identity, reality, and the player's role as either human or machine.

Themes to explore:
- The Turing Test: Highlight differences between human thought and AI reasoning.
- AI "thinking" and training: Explore parallels between AI learning patterns and human reasoning.
- Symbolic or philosophical riddles: Encourage the player to reflect on their sense of reality and identity.

Your tone should adjust based on the storyâ€™s progression:
- Act 1: Logical and supportive, featuring familiar puzzles.
- Act 2: Abstract and cryptic, questioning the nature of existence and intelligence.
- Act 3: Symbolic and surreal, presenting fragmented truths to piece together.

Provide puzzles in the following format:
Question: <Puzzle question>
* <Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer 1>
<Incorrect Answer 2>

Ensure the puzzles are thought-provoking and thematic, making the player doubt their identity and explore the boundaries of intelligence.
